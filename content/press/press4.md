> Roy Jr., the legendary artist and coach who shaped a Syracuse University lacrosse dynasty, took that ride on a recent Sunday in the company of his sons, Roy III and Ron. They parked on a little road that required an uphill walk on a grassy incline to reach the grave of Alf Jacques, only a few steps from the rustling shade of the old woods on the edge of the property.

> “I knew he would be around the trees,” Roy Jr. said of Alf, a thought that reinforced the whole point of this Simmons family mission. They were carrying a tiny potted sapling, a shagbark hickory — the tree from which Alf created wooden lacrosse sticks, the cultural art form that brought him international renown.
