> Roy Simmons Jr. remained seated as he spoke, for the 90-year-old’s voice is now much stronger than his legs. Simmons Jr. held his microphone tightly, surrounded by his loved ones as he accepted the Alfie Jacques Ambassador Award.
> There was an extra guest at the table, too. A green pot rested in front of him, a hickory sapling sprouting from it.
> In forests, Alfie Jacques didn’t see trees. He saw lacrosse sticks. The Onondaga stickmaker learned to make sticks from his father, Louis, and before his death in 2023, he dedicated the rest of life to perfecting his craft. Whenever Jacques felled a tree, he placed a hickory nut in the soil surrounding it. He was a man of principle, and if he took a tree from the earth, it needed to be replaced.
