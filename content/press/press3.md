> Oren Lyons and Roy Simmons Jr. have already experienced what might seem like the ultimate forms of tribute. There’s a building named for Lyons, an internationally renowned faithkeeper from the Onondaga Nation, at Syracuse University. A statue of Simmons, alongside a matching one of his late father — they both were lacrosse-coaching legends at SU — keeps vigil on Orange student-athletes as they come and go from practice.
> 
> Yet Lyons and Simmons both say an award they’ll accept side-by-side in mid-September holds extraordinary lifetime meaning.
