In 2025, for the first time, the award will be presented to two recipients — Onondaga Nation Turtle Clan Faithkeeper Oren Lyons and Coach Roy Simmons Jr. — two longtime friends and former teammates whose lives and legacies stand as profound representations of what the game of lacrosse is about. Both Lyons and Simmons have walked alongside Alfie Jacques for decades, as advocates and storytellers. They have lived lives that reflect the deep spiritual and communal roots of the game.

The legendary former head coach of Syracuse University men’s lacrosse, Roy Simmons Jr. is widely credited for elevating the sport while also maintaining a connection to its Indigenous heritage. A lifelong friend of Alfie Jacques, Simmons made it his mission to introduce players, fans, and the broader public to the Native origins of lacrosse, often inviting Alfie to speak to his teams and shaping a culture of respect and curiosity. Known as much for his connection to his players as for his national titles, Simmons championed creativity in all aspects of his coaching. “When the award was created, we discussed the balance between North American and International recipients and that one day we may want to honor more than one person per year,” said Robert Carpenter, Founder of Inside Lacrosse Magazine. “It wasn’t the plan to pick two recipients so soon, but when the idea of honoring the two lifelong friends, teammates and lacrosse iconoclasts was examined, it’s a step the board unanimously and enthusiastically wanted to take.”
