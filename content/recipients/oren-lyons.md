In 2025, for the first time, the award will be presented to two recipients — Onondaga Nation Turtle Clan Faithkeeper Oren Lyons and Coach Roy Simmons Jr. — two longtime friends and former teammates whose lives and legacies stand as profound representations of what the game of lacrosse is about. Both Lyons and Simmons have walked alongside Alfie Jacques for decades, as advocates and storytellers. They have lived lives that reflect the deep spiritual and communal roots of the game.

A Faithkeeper of the Turtle Clan of the Onondaga Nation and a lifelong defender of Indigenous rights and the natural world, Oren Lyons has been a guiding force in preserving the sacred origins of lacrosse. As a former Syracuse University goaltender and a central voice in the
creation of the Iroquois Nationals, Lyons has brought Indigenous philosophy and diplomacy to global forums while always continuing to honor the spiritual essence of the game. Through his oratory, leadership, and advocacy, Lyons embodies the clarity, humility, and cultural reverence that defined Alfie Jacques and that this award seeks to uphold.
