They didn’t have the money to buy sticks, so as Alfie explained countless times, “my father and I said what the heck, let’s make our own.” At the peak of wooden stick usage, Alfie and Lou made 12,000 sticks a year. The arrival of plastic sticks had a devastating effect on their business. But Alfie never quit. His stick making story is a story of perseverance and perpetuating Onondaga history and ceremony."

### STICKMAKER, COACH, EDUCATOR

Alfie was known as a world-class stickmaker. He was also a
coach, speaker, educator, and Ambassador for lacrosse called
the Medicine Game or Creator’s Game to Alfie’s peoples.
Alfie loved lacrosse and he loved the people who played it,
from all walks of life. He created a traveling roadshow with
the different sticks from different regions, and he would
speak to any audience about the rich history of the
Creator’s Game. In a world where efforts are made to grow
lacrosse at any cost, Alfie worked to grow the game slowly,
steadily, and the right way. This meant growing the game in
ways that held reverence for the heritage before
commercialization. He cherished working with youth. The
Native Vision program was a favorite for Alfie. He traveled
across the country to this Indigenous youth sports and
development camp that promoted cultural values and well-
being on and off a sports field.
