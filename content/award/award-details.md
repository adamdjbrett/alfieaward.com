The Alfie Jacques Ambassador Award will begin the [Haudenosaunee Wooden Stick Fesstival and Restore Our Sacred Lake 5K which will be taking](https://aila.ngo/the-restore-our-sacred-lake-5k-and-haudenosaunee-wooden-stick-festival-weekend-september-13th-and-14th-at-onondaga-lake-park/).

The award will be given to someone who has displayed selfless dedication and energy in growing the game. They must possess the passion that was inherent in Alfie’s mission and the Medicine Game. They will have used lacrosse to connect people in friendship and peace and, like Alfie, be true ambassadors of the game. The recipient can be from anywhere in the world. A college scholarship named for Alfie Jacques will also be given to a Native American youth who has demonstrated outstanding sportsmanship, educational commitment, community service and citizenship. This scholarship will be run through Native Vision’s national competition.
