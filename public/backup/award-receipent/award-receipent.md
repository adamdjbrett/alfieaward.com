In 2025, for the first time, the award will be presented to two recipients — Onondaga Nation Turtle Clan Faithkeeper Oren Lyons and Coach Roy Simmons Jr. — two longtime friends and former teammates whose lives and legacies stand as profound representations of what the game of lacrosse is about. Both Lyons and Simmons have walked alongside Alfie Jacques for decades, as advocates and storytellers. They have lived lives that reflect the deep spiritual and communal roots of the game.
